## Reflections

**I need again revise all course TypeScript by Microsoft, because on lot of the course things I will be watch differently. I mean that when I developed Migration to TS, I used code for this task and I felt how this works.**
**But I can write about each module not much at all:**


**Getting Started with TypeScript**: *This module is very simple. I learned "What is TypeScript?" I wrote code in the Playground*;

**Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: *I learned primitive types, union and intersection types, collection types. And I learned about "any" and "unknown" types*;

**Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: *I learned about interfaces. I think that topic isn't hard. Just practice*;

**Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: *I made function and this similar as like JavaScript. The main, you need use type*;

**Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: *I learned about classes. I learned access modifier as like public, private, protected. In my opinion, one's the main in this topic that extend a class using inheritance*;

**Generics in TypeScript**: *I need to study this module. I have a general picture of topic*;

**Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: *I need to study this module. I have superficial information of topic*;

**Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: *This topic I learned when I developed Migration to TS, but revise this topic will be useful for me*;
