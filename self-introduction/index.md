Hi everyone.
My name is Vadim. And I am from Brest, Belarus. Today, I am living in Warsaw, Poland with my wife and our love dog. I’d like to show you my dog.

I’m speaking with a dog…

Unfortunately, I can’t to show you my wife, because she is at work.
She is very beautiful and kind (but I wanted to say that she is “clever” :))

Every evenings, we go out with dog and we learn or revise new English words.
Unfortunately, my English is at a lower level. But, I can speak English a little.
Two times a week I learn English with help tutor. But I haven’t perfect level to watch films without translate.

Also, I can speak and write Polish. My Polish is not bad. Sometimes, my wife and I speak Polish at home. We also used to learn Polish when we went out with a dog in the evenings. Often, it was funny.

What about programming?
I’d like to show you my working place. Here I spend more time during the day.
When I started to learn JavaScript, it was terrible. Many things of programming I didn’t understand. Today I feel better of programming, but I still have a lot of to learn.

That’s all. Thank you. Have a nice day. Bye!
